Sentiment analysis is a technique that uses natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information in a text. It can help to understand the opinions, emotions, and intentions of customers, users, or other stakeholders in various domains and channels.
