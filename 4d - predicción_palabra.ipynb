[Chorus] It\\'s up to me and you Love can conquer hate I know this to be true That\\'s what makes us great I come from down in the valley Where mister when you\\'re young They bring you up to do like your daddy done Me and Mary we met in high school When she was just seventeen We\\'d ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green We\\'d go down to the river And into the river we\\'d dive Oh down to the river we\\'d ride Then I got Mary pregnant And man that was all she wrote And for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat We went down to the courthouse And the judge put it all to rest No wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle No flowers no wedding dress That night we went down to the river And into the river we\\'d dive Oh down to the river we did ride I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company But lately there ain\\'t been much work on account of the economy Now all them things that seemed so important Well mister they vanished right into the air Now I just act like I don\\'t remember Mary acts like she don\\'t care But I remember us riding in my brother\\'s car Her body tan and wet down at the reservoir At night on them banks I\\'d lie awake And pull her close just to feel each breath she\\'d take Now those memories come back to haunt me They haunt me like a curse Is a dream a lie if it don\\'t come true Or is it something worse That sends me down to the river Though I know the river is dry That sends me down to the river tonight Down to the river My baby and I Oh down to the river we ride The screen door slams, Mary\\'s dress waves Like a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays Roy Orbison singing for the lonely Hey, that\\'s me and I want you only Don\\'t turn me home again, I just can\\'t face myself alone again Don\\'t run back inside, darling, you know just what I\\'m here for So you\\'re scared and you\\'re thinking that maybe we ain\\'t that young anymore Show a little faith, there\\'s magic in the night You ain\\'t a beauty but, hey, you\\'re alright Oh, and that\\'s alright with me You can hide \\'neath your covers and study your pain Make crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain Waste your summer praying in vain For a savior to rise from these streets Well now, I ain\\'t no hero, that\\'s understood All the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood With a chance to make it good somehow Hey, what else can we do now? Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair Well, the night\\'s busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere We got one last chance to make it real To trade in these wings on some wheels Climb in back, heaven\\'s waiting on down the tracks Oh oh, come take my hand We\\'re riding out tonight to case the promised land Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road Lying out there like a killer in the sun Hey, I know it\\'s late, we can make it if we run Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road Sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk And my car\\'s out back if you\\'re ready to take that long walk From your front porch to my front seat The door\\'s open but the ride ain\\'t free And I know you\\'re lonely for words that I ain\\'t spoken But tonight we\\'ll be free, all the promises\\'ll be broken There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets They scream your name at night in the street Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet And in the lonely cool before dawn You hear their engines rolling on But when you get to the porch, they\\'re gone on the wind So Mary, climb in It\\'s a town full of losers, I\\'m pulling out of here to win I get up in the evening And I ain\\'t got nothing to say I come home in the morning I go to bed feeling the same way I ain\\'t nothing but tired Man I\\'m just tired and bored with myself Hey there baby, I could use just a little help You can\\'t start a fire You can\\'t start a fire without a spark This gun\\'s for hire Even if we\\'re just dancing in the dark Message keeps getting clearer Radio\\'s on and I\\'m moving \\'round the place I check my look in the mirror I want to change my clothes, my hair, my face Man I ain\\'t getting nowhere I\\'m just living in a dump like this There\\'s something happening somewhere Baby I just know that there is You can\\'t start a fire You can\\'t start a fire without a spark This gun\\'s for hire Even if we\\'re just dancing in the dark You sit around getting older There\\'s a joke here somewhere and it\\'s on me I\\'ll shake this world off my shoulders Come on baby this laugh\\'s on me Stay on the streets of this town And they\\'ll be carving you up alright They say you gotta stay hungry Hey baby I\\'m just about starving tonight I\\'m dying for some action I\\'m sick of sitting \\'round here trying to write this book I need a love reaction Come on now baby gimme just one look You can\\'t start a fire sitting \\'round crying over a broken heart This gun\\'s for hire Even if we\\'re just dancing in the dark You can\\'t start a fire worrying about your little world falling apart This gun\\'s for hire Even if we\\'re just dancing in the dark Even if we\\'re just dancing in the dark Even if we\\'re just dancing in the dark Even if we\\'re just dancing in the dark Hey baby Well, it seems like

Trapped, oh yeah I\\'m trapped In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream At night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines Sprung from cages out on highway nine, Chrome wheeled, fuel injected,and steppin\\' out over the line H-Oh, Baby this town rips the bones from your back It\\'s a death trap, it\\'s a suicide rap We gotta get out while we\\'re young `Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run Yes, girl we were Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend I want to guard your dreams and visions Just wrap your legs \\'round these velvet rims And

and lonely rider But I gotta know how it feels I want to know if love is wild Babe I want to know if love is real Oh, can you show me Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard Girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors And the boys try to look so hard The amusement park rises bold and stark Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist I wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight In an everlasting kiss One, two, three, four! The highway\\'s jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive Everybody\\'s out on the run tonight But there\\'s no place left to hide Together Wendy we can live with the sadness I\\'ll love you with all the madness in my soul H-Oh, Someday girl I don\\'t know when We\\'re gonna get to that place Where we really wanna go And we\\'ll walk in the sun But till then tramps like us Baby we were born to run Oh honey, tramps like us Baby we were born to run Come on with me, tramps like us Baby we were born to run Men walking \\'long the railroad tracks Going someplace, there\\'s no going back Highway patrol choppers coming up over the ridge Hot soup on a campfire under the bridge Shelter line stretching \\'round the corner Welcome to the new world order Families sleeping in the cars in the southwest No home, no job, no peace, no rest Well the highway is alive tonight But nobody\\'s kidding nobody about where it goes I\\'m sitting down here in the campfire light Searching for the ghost of Tom Joad He pulls a prayer book out of his sleeping bag Preacher lights up a butt and he takes a drag Waiting for when the last shall be first and the first shall be last In a cardboard box \\'neath the underpass You got a one-way ticket to the promised land You got a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand Sleeping on a pillow of solid rock Bathing in the city\\'s aqueduct Go! Well the highway is alive tonight Where it\\'s headed everybody knows I\\'m sitting down here in the campfire light Waiting on the ghost of Tom Joad Now Tom said, \"Mom, wherever there\\'s a cop beating a guy Wherever a hungry newborn baby cries Where there\\'s a fight against the blood and hatred in the air Look for me, Mom, I\\'ll be there Wherever somebody\\'s fighting for a place to stand Or a decent job or a helping hand Wherever somebody\\'s struggling to be free Look in their eyes, Ma, and you\\'ll see me\" Yeah! The highway is alive tonight Where it\\'s headed everybody knows I\\'m sitting down here in the campfire light With the ghost of old Tom Joad It\\'s rainin\\' but there ain\\'t a cloud in the sky Musta been a tear from your eye Everything\\'ll be okay Funny thought I felt a sweet summer breeze Musta been you sighin\\' so deep Don\\'t worry we\\'re gonna find a way I\\'m waitin\\', waitin\\' on

Without you I\\'m a drummer girl that can\\'t keep a beat An ice cream truck on a deserted street I hope that you\\'re coming to stay I\\'m waitin\\', waitin\\' on a sunny day Gonna chase the clouds away Waitin\\' on a sunny day Hard times baby, well they come to tell us all Sure as the tickin\\' of the clock on the wall Sure as the turnin\\' of the night into day Your smile girl, brings the mornin\\' light to my eyes Lifts away the blues when I rise I hope that you\\'re coming to stay I\\'m waitin\\', waitin\\' on a sunny day Gonna chase the clouds away Waitin\\' on a sunny day Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin\\' kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-round With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing, the calliope crashed to the ground Some all-hot half-shot was headin\\' for the hot spot, snappin\\' his fingers, clappin\\' his hands And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover\\'s knot with a whatnot in her hand And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand And some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers, daddy\\'s within earshot, save the buckshot, turn up the band And she was blinded by the light Oh cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night Blinded by the light She got down but she never got tight, but she\\'ll make it alright Some brimstone baritone anti-cyclone rolling stone preacher from the East He says, dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that\\'s where they expect it least And some new-mown chaperone was standin\\' in the corner all alone, watchin\\' the young girls dance And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin\\' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance Yeah, he was blinded by the light Oh, cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night Blinded by the light He got down but he never got tight, but he\\'s gonna make it tonight Some silicone sister with her manager\\'s mister told me I got what it takes She said, I\\'ll turn you on, sonny, to something strong if you play that song with the funky break And Go-Cart Mozart was checkin\\' out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside And little Early-Pearly came by in her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer, playin\\' backyard bombardier Yes, and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent some dude with a calling card, he said, do what you like, but don\\'t do it here Well, I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground and asked him which was the way back home He said, take a right at the light, keep goin\\' straight until night, and then, boy, you\\'re on your own And now in Zanzibar, a shootin\\' star was ridin\\' in a side car, hummin\\' a lunar tune Yes, and the avatar said, blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar, we\\'re gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon And some kidnapped handicap was complainin\\' that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night Well, I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw a gap but figured he\\'d be all right He was just blinded by the light Cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night Blinded by the light Mama always told me not to look into the sights of the sun Oh, but Mama, that\\'s where the fun is Ooh yeah I was blinded I was blinded I was blinded I was blinded I was blinded I was blinded I was blinded I was blinded Hey little girl is

this morning my house was cold Checked out the furnace she wasn\\'t burnin\\' Went out and hoped in my old Ford Hit the engine but she ain\\'t turnin\\' We\\'ve given each other some hard lessons lately But we ain\\'t learnin\\' We\\'re the same sad story that\\'s a fact One step up and two steps back Bird on a wire outside my motel room But he ain\\'t singin\\' Girl in white outside a church in June But the church bells they ain\\'t ringing I\\'m sittin\\' here in this bar tonight But all I\\'m thinkin\\' is I\\'m the same old story same old act One step up and two steps back It\\'s the same thing night on night Who\\'s wrong baby who\\'s right Another fight and I slam the door on Another battle in our dirty little war When I look at myself I don\\'t see The man I wanted to be Somewhere along the line I slipped off track I\\'m caught movin\\' one step up and two steps back There\\'s a girl across the bar I get the message she\\'s sendin\\' Mmm she ain\\'t lookin\\' to married And me well honey I\\'m pretending Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms The music was never-ending We danced as the evening sky faded to black One step up and two steps back Last night I dreamed that I was a child Out where the pines grow wild and tall I was trying to make it home through the forest Before the darkness falls I heard the wind rustling through the trees And ghostly voices rose from the fields I ran with my heart pounding down that broken path With the devil snapping at my heels I broke through the trees and there in the night My father\\'s house stood shining hard and bright The branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms But I ran till I fell shaking in his arms I awoke and I imagined, the hard things that pulled us apart Will never again, sir, tear us from each other\\'s hearts I got dressed and to that house I did ride From out on the road I could see its windows shining in light I walked up the steps and stood on the porch A woman I didn\\'t recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door I told her my story and who I\\'d come for She said \"I\\'m sorry son but no one by that name lives here anymore\" My father\\'s house shines hard and bright It stands like a beacon calling me in the night Calling and calling, so cold and alone Shining \\'cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned Well you don\\'t like, don\\'t like the way I walk And you don\\'t like, don\\'t like the way I talk You criticize about me endlessly Logic defies how you get stuck with me And you complain about the clothes I wear And you explain there\\'s other boys out there You complain my car makes too much noise And you cry I\\'m always out with the boys Whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa) I give up little darling (whoa whoa little darling) Yeah no matter what I do, girl you know it\\'s true Ain\\'t good enough for you You complain the way I love you at night You explain I\\'m really not your type If we go out, you say I\\'m such a bore If we stay in, you say what are we living for I don\\'t understand, there\\'s nothing I can do There ain\\'t no way I can satisfy you End of the night I lean in for a kiss Here comes the pitch, a swing and a miss Whoa whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa) I quit little darling (whoa whoa little darling) Yeah no matter what I do, well you know it\\'s true Ain\\'t good enough for you, hey! Hey! (Come on boys!) Whoa whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa) Hey hey little darling (whoa whoa little darling) No matter what I do, girl you know it\\'s true Ain\\'t good enough for you I tried to change, I got a job in sales I bought a shirt uptown in Bloomindales And babe I tried to make the latest scene Hitting cool just like Jimmy Iovine I bought a record with all the latest grooves A book of love with all the latest moves I bought some flowers and I waited at your door And you came out, didn\\'t want to see me no more Whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa) I quit little darling (whoa whoa little darling) Yeah no matter what I do, girl you know it\\'s true Ain\\'t good enough for you Hey! Hey! Hey! No matter what I do, girl you know it\\'s true Ain\\'t good enough for you Aww no matter what I do, girl you know it\\'s true Ain\\'t good enough for you Whoaaa! We played king of the mountain out on the end The world come chargin\\' up the hill, and we were women and men Now there\\'s so much that time, time and memory fade away We got our own roads to ride and chances we gotta take We stood side by side each one fightin\\' for the other We said until we died we\\'d always be blood brothers Now the hardness of this world slowly grinds your dreams away Makin\\' a fool\\'s joke out of the promises we make And what once seemed black and white turns to so many shades of gray We lose ourselves in work to do and bills to pay And it\\'s a ride, ride, ride, and there ain\\'t much cover With no one runnin\\' by your side my blood brother On through the houses of the dead past those fallen in their tracks Always movin\\' ahead and never lookin\\' back Now I don\\'t know how I feel, I don\\'t know how I feel tonight If I\\'ve fallen \\'neath the wheel, if I\\'ve lost or I\\'ve gained sight I don\\'t even know why, I don\\'t know why I made this call Or if any of this matters anymore after all But the stars are burnin\\' bright like some mistery uncovered I\\'ll keep movin\\' through the dark with you in my heart My blood brother Do you still say your prayers little darlin\\' Do you go to bed at night Prayin\\' that tomorrow, everything will be alright But tomorrow\\'s fall in number In number one by one You wake up and you\\'re dying You don\\'t even know what from Well they shot you point blank You been shot in the back Baby point blank you been fooled this time Little girl that\\'s a fact Right between the eyes, baby, point blank Right between the pretty lies that they tell Little girl you fell You grew up where young girls they grow up fast You took what you were handed and left behind what was asked But what they asked baby wasn\\'t right You didn\\'t have to live that life I was gonna be your Romeo you were gonna be my Juliet These days you don\\'t wait on Romeos You wait on that welfare check And on all the pretty things that you can\\'t ever have And on all the promises That always end up point blank Shot between the eyes Oh, point blank Like little white lies you tell to ease the pain You\\'re walkin\\' in the sights, girl of point blank And it\\'s one false move and baby the lights go out Once I dreamed we were together again Baby you and me Back home in those old clubs the way we used to be We were standin\\' at the bar It was hard to hear The band was playin\\' loud and you were shoutin\\' somethin\\' in my ear You pulled my jacket off and as the drummer counted four You grabbed my hand and pulled me out on the floor You just stood there and held me, then you started dancin\\' slow And as I pulled you tighter I swore I\\'d never let you go Well I saw you last night down on the avenue Your face was in the shadows but I knew that it was you You were standin\\' in the doorway out of the rain You didn\\'t answer when I called out your name You just turned, and then you looked away Like just another stranger waitin\\' to get blown away Point blank Right between the eyes Oh, point blank Right between the pretty lies you fell Point blank Shot straight through the heart Yeah point blank You\\'ve been twisted up \\'til you\\'ve become just another part of it Point blank, you\\'re walkin\\' in the sights Point blank Livin\\' one false move just one false move away Point blank They caught you in their sights Point blank Did you forget how to love Girl, did you forget how to fight Point blank They must have shot you in the head \\'Cause point blank Bang bang baby you\\'re dead Woke up this morning, was a chill in the air Went into the kitchen, your cigarettes were lying there Your jacket hung on the chair where you left it last night Everything was in place, everything was all right But you were missing Missing... Last night I dreamed the sky went black You were drifting down and you couldn\\'t get back You were lost and in trouble so far from home I reached for you, my arms went to stone I woke and you were missing Missing... I searched for something to explain In the whispering rain, the trembling leaves Tell me baby where did you go You were here just a moment ago There\\'s nights I still hear your footsteps fall Your key in the door, your voice in the hall Your smell drifts through our bedroom I wake, but I don\\'t move With her killer graces and her secret places that no boy can fill With her hands on her hips, oh, and that smile on her lips because she knows that it kills me With her soft French cream, standing in that doorway like a dream, I wish she\\'d just leave me alone Because French cream won\\'t soften them boots and French kisses will not break that heart of stone With her long hair falling and her eyes that shine like a midnight sun Whoa-oh, she\\'s the one She\\'s the one That thunder in your heart at night when you\\'re kneeling in the dark, it say\\'s you\\'re never gonna leave her But there\\'s this angel in her eyes that tells such desperate lies and all you want to do is believe her And tonight you\\'ll try just one more time to leave it all behind and to break on through Oh, she can take you, but if she wants to break you, she\\'s gonna find out that ain\\'t so easy to do And no matter where you sleep tonight or how far you run Whoa-oh, she\\'s the one She\\'s the one Oh oh, and just one kiss, she\\'s fill them long summer nights with her tenderness That secret pact you made, back when her love could save you from the bitterness Oh, she\\'s the one Oh, she\\'s the one Oh, she\\'s the one Oh, she\\'s the one Oh, she\\'s the one Oh, she\\'s the one In my dreams our love was lost. I lived by luck and faith. I carried you inside of me, prayed it wouldn\\'t be too late. Now i\\'m standing on this empty road, where nothing moves but the wind. And honey I just wanna be Back in your arms, back in your arms again. Back in your arms, back in your arms again Oh once I was your treasure, and I saw your face in every star. But these promises we make at night, oh that\\'s all they are. Unless we fill them with faith and love they\\'re empty as a howlin\\' wind. And honey I just wanna be Back in your arms, back in your arms again.. Back in your arms, back in your arms again. Back in your arms, back in your arms again. You came to me with love and kindness, but all my life I\\'ve been a prisoner of my own blindness. I met you with indifference, and I don\\'t know why. Now I wake from my dream, I wake from my dream to this world. Where all the shadow and darkness and above me a dark sky unfurls. And all the love I\\'ve thrown away and lost, I\\'m longing for again. Now darling I just wanna be Back in your arms, back in your arms again. Back in your arms, back in your arms again. Back in your arms, back in your arms again. Back in your arms Every day here you come walking I hold my tongue, I don\\'t do much talking You say you\\'re happy and you\\'re doin\\' fine Well go ahead, baby, I got plenty of time Sad eyes never lie Sad eyes never lie Well for a while I\\'ve been watching you steady Ain\\'t gonna move \\'til you\\'re good and ready You show up and then you shy away But I know pretty soon you\\'ll be walkin\\' this way Sad eyes never lie Sad eyes never lie Baby don\\'t you know I don\\'t care Don\\'t you know that I\\'ve been there Well if something in the air feels a little unkind Don\\'t worry darling, it\\'ll slip your mind I know you think you\\'d never be mine Well that\\'s okay, baby, I don\\'t mind That shy smile\\'s sweet, that\\'s a fact Go ahead, I don\\'t mind the act Here you come all dressed up for a date Well one more step and it\\'ll be too late Blue blue ribbon in your hair Like you\\'re so sure I\\'ll be standing here I\\'ve got a mule and her name is Sal Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal She\\'s a good old worker and a good old pal Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal We haul\\'d some barges in our day Filled with lumber, coal and hay We know every inch of the way From Albany to Bufallo Low bridge, ev\\'rybody down Low bridge, we\\'re coming to a town You\\'ll always know your neighbour And you\\'ll always know your pal If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal We\\'d better look around for a job, old gal Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal You can bet your life I\\'ll never part Sal Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal Get up mule, here comes a lock We\\'ll make Rome \\'bout six o\\'clock One more trip and we\\'ll go Right back home to Buffalo Low bridge, ev\\'rybody down Low bridge, we\\'re coming to a town You\\'ll always know your neighbour And you\\'ll always know your pal If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal Where would I be if I lost my pal?

I was too loose to fake I said, I\\'m hurt, she said, honey, let me heal it And we danced all night to a soul fairy band And she kissed me just right, like only a lonely angel can She felt so nice Just as soft as a spirit in the night (all night), in the night (all night) Janey don\\'t know what she do to you Spirit in the night (all night), in the night (all night) Stand right up and let her

these guitars \\'Cause we made a promise we swore we\\'d always remember No retreat, baby, no surrender Blood brothers in the stormy night With a vow to defend No retreat, baby, no surrender Now on the street tonight the lights grow dim The walls of my room are closing in There\\'s a war outside still raging You say it ain\\'t ours anymore to win I want to sleep beneath Peaceful skies in my lover\\'s bed With a wide open country in my eyes And these romantic dreams in my head Once we made a promise we swore we\\'d always remember No retreat, baby, no surrender Blood brothers in a stormy night With a vow to defend No retreat, baby, no surrender No retreat, baby, no surrender Ohh ohh ohh Ohh ohh ohh Ohh ohh ohh Ohh ohh ohh Here in north east Ohio Back in eighteen-o-three James and Danny Heaton Found the ore that was linin\\' yellow creek They built a blast furnace Here along the shore And they made the cannon balls That helped the union win the war Here in Youngstown Here in Youngstown My sweet Jenny, I\\'m sinkin\\' down Here darlin\\' in Youngstown Well my daddy worked the furnaces Kept \\'em hotter than hell I come home from \\'Nam worked my way to scarfer A job

in the fiery furnaces of hell The Rangers had a homecoming In Harlem late last night And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine Over the Jersey state line Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain The Rat pulls into town, rolls up his pants Together they take a stab at romance And disappear down Flamingo Lane Well, the Maximum Lawmen run down Flamingo Chasing the Rat and the barefoot girl And the kids \\'round there live just like shadows Always quiet, holding hands From the churches to the jails Tonight all is silence in the world As we take our stand Down in Jungleland The midnight gang\\'s assembled And picked a rendezvous for the night They\\'ll meet \\'neath that giant Exxon sign That brings this fair city light Man, there\\'s an opera out on the Turnpike There\\'s a ballet being fought out in the alley Until the local cops, Cherry-Tops, rips this holy night The street\\'s alive as secret debts are paid Contacts made, they flash unseen Kids flash guitars just like switchblades Hustling for the record machine The hungry and the hunted Explode into rock \\'n\\' roll bands That face off against each other out in the street Down in Jungleland In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage Inside the backstreet girls are dancing To the records that the DJ plays Lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners Desperate as the night moves on Just one look and a whisper, and they\\'re gone Beneath the city, two hearts beat Soul engines running through a night so tender In a bedroom locked in whispers Of soft refusal and then surrender In the tunnels uptown, the Rat\\'s own dream guns him down As shots echo down them hallways in the night No one watches when the ambulance pulls away Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light Outside the street\\'s on fire in a real death waltz Between what\\'s flesh and what\\'s fantasy And the poets down here don\\'t write nothing at all They just stand back and let it all be And in the quick of a knife, they reach for their moment And try to make an honest stand But they wind up wounded, not even dead Tonight in Jungleland I\\'ve been working real hard, trying to get my hands clean We\\'ll drive that dusty road from Monroe to Angeline To buy you a gold ring and pretty dress of blue Baby just one kiss will get these things for you A kiss to seal our fate tonight A kiss to prove it all night Prove it all night Girl there\\'s nothing else that we can do So prove it all night Prove it all night And girl I\\'ll prove it all night for you Everybody\\'s got a hunger, a hunger they can\\'t resist There\\'s so much that you want, you deserve much more than this But if dreams came true, oh, wouldn\\'t that be nice But this ain\\'t no dream we\\'re living through tonight Girl, you want it, you take it, you pay the price Prove it all night Prove it all night Prove it all night girl and call the bluff We\\'ll prove it all night Prove it all night Girl I\\'ll prove it all night for your love Baby, tie your hair back in a long white bow Meet me in the fields out behind the dynamo You hear their voices telling you not to go They\\'ve made their choices and they\\'ll never know What it means to steal, to cheat, to lie What it\\'s like to live and die Prove it all night Prove it all night Girl there\\'s nothing else that we can do So prove it all night Prove it all night And girl I\\'ll prove it all night for you I\\'ll prove it all night I\\'ll prove it all night I\\'ll prove it all night I\\'ll prove it all night I\\'ll prove it all

Hey hey hey hey Hey hey hey hey Hey hey hey hey The runway rushed up at him as he felt the wheels touch down He stood out on the blacktop and took a taxi into town He got out down on Main Street and went into a local bar He bought a drink and found a seat in a corner off the dark Well she called up her mama to make sure the kids were out of the house She checked herself out in the dining room mirror And undid an extra button on her blouse He felt her lying next to him, the clock said 4:00 am He was staring at the ceiling He couldn\\'t move his hands [Chorus] Oh mama mama mama come quick I\\'ve got the shakes and I\\'m gonna be sick Throw your arms around me in the cold dark night Hey now mama don\\'t shut out the light Don\\'t you shut out the light Don\\'t you shut out the light Don\\'t you shut out the light Don\\'t you shut out the light Well on his porch they stretched a banner that said \"Johnny Welcome Home\" Bobby pulled his Ford out of the garage and they polished up the chrome His mama said \"Johnny oh Johnny, I\\'m so glad to have you back with me\" His pa said he was sure they\\'d give him his job back down at the factory [Chorus] Well deep in a dark forest, a forest filled with rain Beyond a stretch of Maryland pines there\\'s a river without a name In the cold black water Johnson Lineir stands He stares across the lights of the city and dreams of where he\\'s been [Chorus] I was raised out of steel here in the swamps of Jersey, some misty years ago Through the mud and the beer, and the blood and the cheers, I\\'ve seen champions come and go So if you got the guts mister, yeah if you\\'ve got the balls If you think it\\'s your time, then step to the line, and bring on your wrecking ball Bring on your wrecking ball Bring on your wrecking ball Come on and take your best shot, let me see what you\\'ve got Bring on your wrecking ball Bring on your wrecking ball Bring on your wrecking ball Come on and take your best shot, let me see what you\\'ve got Bring on your wrecking ball Now my home was here in the Meadowlands, where mosquitoes grow big as airplanes Here where the blood is spilled, the arena\\'s filled, and Giants play the game So raise up your glasses and let me hear your voices call Come on! Because tonight all the dead are here, so bring on your wrecking ball Bring on your wrecking ball Bring on your wrecking ball Take your best shot, let me see what you\\'ve got Bring on your wrecking ball One, two, one two three four! Yeah we know that come tomorrow, none of this will be here So hold tight on your anger Hold tight on your anger Hold tight to your anger, and don\\'t fall to your fear Now when all this steel and these stories, they drift away to rust And all our youth and beauty, it\\'s been given to the dust And your game has been decided, and you\\'re burning the clock down And all our little victories and glories, have turned into parking lots When your best hopes and desires, are scattered through the wind And hard times come, hard times go Hard times come, hard times go And hard times come, hard times go Hard times come, hard times go Hard times come, hard times go Yeah just to come again Bring on your wrecking ball Bring on your wrecking ball Come on and take your best shot, let me see what you\\'ve got Bring on your wrecking ball Bring on your wrecking ball (bring on your wrecking ball) Bring on your wrecking ball (bring on your wrecking ball) Take your best shot, let me see what you\\'ve got, bring on your wrecking ball One, two, one two three four! We met out on open streets When we had no place to go I remember how my heart beat When you said \"i love you so\" Then little by little We choked out all the life that out love could hold No, no It was like we held a noose And baby without check We pulled it a little tighter around our necks Each one waiting for the other Darling to say when Now baby you can leave me tonight on the loose end We didn\\'t count tomorrows We took what we had and baby we ran There was no place for sorrow Every place we went I held your hand And when the night closed in I was sure your kisses told me all I had to know But oh no It was like we held a noose And baby without check We pulled \\'til it grew tighter around our necks Each one waiting for the other Darling to say when Oh baby you can leave me tonight on the loose end Our love has fallen around us Like we said it never would We saw it happen to all the others But to us it never would Well how could something so bad, darling Come from something that was so good I don\\'t know But it was like we held a noose And baby without check We pulled \\'til it grew tighter around our necks Each one waiting for the other Darling to say when Oh baby you can leave me tonight on the loose end On a loose end There\\'s a pale horse comin\\' I\\'m gonna ride it I\\'ll rise in the morning My fate decided I\\'m a dead man walkin\\' I\\'m a dead man walkin\\' In St. James Parish I was born and christened Now I\\'ve got my story Mister no need for you to listen It\\'s just a dead man talkin\\' Once I had a job I had a girl But between our dreams and actions Lies this world In the deep forest Their blood and tears rushed over me All I could feel was the drugs and the shotgun And my fear up inside of me Like a dead man talkin\\' \\'Neath a summer sky my eyes went black Sister I won\\'t ask for forgiveness My sins are all I have Now the clouds above my prison Move slowly across the sky There\\'s a new day comin\\' And my dreams are full tonight I was eight years old and running with a dime in my hand Into the bus stop to pick up a paper for my old man I\\'d sit on his lap in that big old Buick and steer as we drove through town He\\'d tousle my hair and say son take a good look around This is your hometown This is your hometown This is your hometown This is your hometown In \\'65 tension was running high at my high school There was a lot of fights between the black and white There was nothing you could do Two cars at a light on a Saturday night in the back seat there was a gun Words were passed in a shotgun blast Troubled times had come To my hometown My hometown My hometown My hometown Now Main Street\\'s whitewashed windows and vacant stores Seems like there ain\\'t nobody wants to come down here no more They\\'re closing down the textile mill across the railroad tracks Foreman says these jobs are going boys and they ain\\'t coming back To your hometown Your hometown Your hometown Your hometown Last night me and Kate we laid in bed Talking about getting out Packing up our bags maybe heading south I\\'m thirty five we got a boy of our own now Last night I sat him up behind the wheel and said son take a good look around This is your hometown Tear drops on the city, Bad Scooter searching for his groove Seem like the whole world walking pretty and you can\\'t find the room to move Well, everybody better move over, that\\'s all \\'Cause I\\'m running on the bad side and I got my back to the wall Tenth Avenue freeze-out Tenth Avenue freeze-out Well, I was stranded in the jungle trying to take in all the heat they was giving The night is dark but the sidewalk\\'s bright and lined with the light of the living From a tenement window a transistor blasts Turn around the corner, things got real quiet real fast I walked into a Tenth Avenue freeze-out Tenth Avenue freeze-out And I\\'m all alone, I\\'m all alone (And kid, you better get the picture) And I\\'m on my own, I\\'m on my own And I can\\'t go home When the change was made uptown and the Big Man joined the band From the coastline to the city, all the little pretties raise their hands I\\'m gonna sit back right easy and laugh When Scooter and the Big Man bust this city in half With the Tenth Avenue freeze-out Tenth Avenue freeze-out Tenth Avenue freeze-out Tenth Avenue freeze I\\'m talking \\'bout a Tenth Oh, nothing but a Tenth I\\'m talking \\'bout a Tenth I\\'m talking bout a Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, Tenth Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, Tenth, I\\'m talking \\'bout a Tenth Avenue freeze-out... The times are tough now, just getting tougher This whole world is rough, it\\'s just getting rougher Cover me, come on baby, cover me Well I\\'m looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me Now promise me baby you won\\'t let them find us Hold me in your arms, let\\'s let our love blind us Cover me, shut the door and cover me I\\'m looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me Outside\\'s the rain, the driving snow I can hear the wild wind blowing Turn out the light, bolt the door I ain\\'t going out there no more This whole world is out there just trying to score I\\'ve seen enough I don\\'t wanna see any more, Cover me, come on in and cover me I\\'m looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me Outside\\'s the rain, the driving snow I can hear the wild wind blowing Turn out the light, bolt the door I ain\\'t going out there no more This whole world is out there just trying to score I\\'ve seen enough I ain\\'t gonna see any more, Cover me, wrap you arms around and cover me Well I\\'m looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me Ah looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me Yeah I\\'m looking for a lover who will come on in and cover me In Candy\\'s room there are pictures of her heroes on the wall But to get to Candy\\'s room you gotta walk the darkness of Candy\\'s hall Strangers from the city, call my baby\\'s number and they bring her toys When I come knocking, she smiles pretty, she knows I want to be Candy\\'s boy There\\'s a sadness hidden in that pretty face A sadness all her own From which no man can keep Candy safe We kiss, my heart\\'s pumpin\\' to my brain And the blood rushes in my veins, the fire rushes towards the skies I go driving, driving deep into the night I go driving deep into the light, in Candy\\'s eyes She says, baby if you want to be wild You got a lot to learn, close your eyes Let them melt, let them fire Let them burn \\'Cause in the darkness, there\\'ll be hidden worlds that shine When I hold Candy close she makes the hidden worlds mine She has fancy clothes and diamond rings She has men who give her anything she wants, but they don\\'t see That what she wants is me Oh, and I want her so I\\'ll never let her go, no, no, no She knows that I\\'d give All that I got to give All that I want, all that I live To make Candy mine Tonight She\\'ll let you in her house If you come knockin\\' late at night She\\'ll let you in her mouth If the words you say are right If you pay the price She\\'ll let you deep inside But there\\'s a secret garden she hides She\\'ll let you in her car To go drivin\\' round She\\'ll let you into the parts of herself That\\'ll bring you down She\\'ll let you in herheart If you got a hammer and a vise But into her secret garden, don\\'t think twice You\\'ve gone a million miles How far\\'d you get To that place where You can\\'t remember And you can\\'t forget She\\'ll lead you down a path There\\'ll be tenderness in the air She\\'ll let you come just far enough So you know she\\'s really there She\\'ll look at you and smile And her eyes will say She\\'s got a secret garden Where everything you want Where everything you need Will always stay A million miles away You stare in the mirror at the lines in your face And you try so hard to see The way things were when we were at your place Everyday was just you and me And you cry because things ain\\'t like before Well, don\\'t you know it can\\'t be that way anymore But don\\'t worry baby \\'cause I can\\'t talk now, I\\'m not alone So put your ear close to the phone \\'cause this is the last dance, the last chance For hearts of stone If there was something, baby, That I could do, Something that would last, honey, I would But you should know better than to think that you Can return to the past So close your eyes and I\\'ll be there Hold you once more and not go anywhere I wish I could babe But I can\\'t talk now, I\\'m not alone So put your ear close to the phone \\'cause this is the last dance, the last chance For hearts of stone And you cry because things get so strange so fast And you cry because nothing good ever lasts Well, I know babe But I can\\'t talk now, I\\'m not alone So put your ear close to the phone \\'cause this is the last dance, the last chance For hearts of stone I can\\'t talk now, I\\'m not alone So put your ear close to the phone \\'cause this is the last dance, the last chance For hearts of stone I went out walking the other day Seen a little girl crying along the way She\\'d been hurt so bad said she\\'d never love again Some day your crying girl will end And you\\'ll find once again Two hearts are better than one Two hearts girl get the job done Two hearts are better than one Once I spent my time playing tough guy scenes But I was living in a world of childish dreams Someday these childish dreams must end To become a man and grow up to dream again I believe in the end Two hearts are better than one Two hearts girl get the job done Two hearts are better than one Sometimes it might seem like it was planned For you to roam empty-hearted through this land Though the world turns you hard and cold There\\'s one thing mister, that I know That\\'s if you think your heart is stone And that you\\'re rough enough to whip this world alone Alone buddy there ain\\'t no peace of mind That\\'s why I\\'ll keep searching \\'til I find my special one Two hearts are better than one Two hearts girl get the job done Two hearts are better than one Oh, two hearts are better than one Two hearts girl get the job done Two hearts are better than one Woah [Verse 1] They come from everywhere A longing to be free They come to join us here From sea to shining sea And they all have a dream As people always will To be safe and warm In that shining city on the hill Some wanna slam the door Instead of opening the gate Aw, let\\'s turn this thing around Before it gets too late [Chorus] It\\'s up to me and you Love can conquer hate I know this to be true That\\'s what makes us great [Verse 2] Don\\'t tell me a lie And sell it as a fact I\\'ve been down that road before And I ain\\'t goin\\' back And don\\'t you brag to me That you never read a book I never put my faith In a con man and his crooks I won\\'t follow down that path And tempt the hands of fate Aw, let\\'s turn this thing around Before it gets too late [Chorus] It\\'s up to me and you Love can conquer hate I know this to be true That\\'s what makes us great In the quiet of the night I lie here wide awake And I ask myself Is there a difference I can make? [Chorus] It\\'s up to me and you Love can conquer hate I know this to be true That\\'s what makes us great'"
